```{r}
sqr <- function(n) {
  x <- n
  y <- 1
  e <- 0.00001
  
 while(x - y > e) {
    x <- (x + y) / 2
    y <- n / x
    print(c(x, y, x-y))
  }
  return(x)
}

n <- 52
sqr(n)
n^0.5      #Control
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
